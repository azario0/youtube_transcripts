       "\"so hello everyone and welcome to this new video about Sovereign practices using using Python and streamnet so in this tutorial I will we will solve some problems okay with python that's programmers deal with every day so on those practices we will display multiple charts on a single window okay on or or multiple window so they need to be ordered so let's dig into the practices so on the 12th practice over here thank you it says to plot four charts two by two of a random 1D array okay so this is quite simple task it doesn't require a lot of things in here so here's the solution solution is quite simple as you can see here this is the chart so this is the first chart this is the second one and this is the third and this is the fourth as you can see there are order that are ordered one by one one next to the other one so there is here a clear order of the display so it's needs some x-axis label and y-axis and the title okay and those things you can do them as I will show you later on you can add those things so yeah this would be perfect if you display for example your project or your data to display them and show them to the the public okay through this API of a streamlined so here is the code solution the code solution was quite simple as you can see there are only few lines of code it's not something really complicated okay only few lines of code so here I put C1 equals random dot run in it so what does that mean as I have explained on the previous video it says to generate a random integer from zero to five so the five is excluded so from 0 to 4 as you can see here the maximum number let's refresh it okay the maximum number is four okay there is no five here and here and here and here so the last one is excluded so there is no five over here it is excluded but it is the limit so for example if I put I put 6 the 6 won't be among the generated items okay so it's from zero to four and the length of the the the array that that's going to be generated is 10 okay so on the first one is 10 second one is done they are all 10 okay so over here there's there is four random numbers okay so over here as you can see there is four charts I didn't want to make uh all the same look at the same so I wanted to make some some diversification okay so and now after doing that I put the condoms okay so sd.com one one so I put over here two columns okay there is this first corner and then there is the second column as you can see the on each one is on each side so this is the first corner so if I display third three chart on this column so it will be longer than the other column the other column will have only one if I wanted to okay so I want it on purpose to display one by one one by one so I know the default size okay so after doing that I've called this function over here and put it on CC1 and cc2 okay and after that I put with CC1 okay I put I draw the line chart okay I can draw for example the bar chart let me show you if you want to see a bar chart let's dig into this solution and I will show you how the bar chart will be displayed okay it's not really something hard let's make here bar chart okay now as you will see there is here a bar chart okay so I was able to display a bar chart that's next to a line chart like so another type of charts okay and it's made easy okay it's not complicated it's something very simple very easy with the stream net okay so it's the perfect tool to display your data to display your portfolio of knowledge okay you can do multiple things on here so I put sd.line chart C1 on the the column this column and I put it on it as the the second chart SC dot line chart C2 okay and with the second columns on the second columns I also put two shots to keep it balanced okay so let's say dot line chart C3 and sd.chart C4 so C3 this is over here the C3 and this is the C4 okay so each one is by on its side I really hope I hope you understand those things if you didn't fit free to send me a message on my link then I will respond as quickly as possible okay so yeah this is uh all about the 12 practice so now let's dig into the third 13 practice the practice number 13. so what does this practice say it's said to write a code that will display for broadly I specified plotly charts okay does this is not a much broadly chart or the default chart of the stream net okay those are plotly charts so the plotly charts as you can see this is an interactive chart okay this is an interactive chart the plotly chart is also interactive as you see over here this is for example a 3D printing okay as you can see it's moving so it is interactive okay so over here it is interactive so I shall do that it is interactive okay so as you can see here on the solution if I reload the page different numbers would show up okay and I've put some diversification as you can see over here they are all different this one over here is different and there is the this part already that shows us the the key is to read those charts okay so yeah it's pretty easy to understand okay so over here you are seeing uh fruit fourth a fourth type of charts that are different each from the other okay so here is the code Solution on the code solution it's as well simple it's a pretty it's a little bit too long but it is simple okay let's bring it down so over here I imported plot T dot graph objects as go so we will use that to put our trust in it and then I've used the zip plots so I didn't use like the previous one sc.coms okay I've used it directly zip plots okay so I put this all as a one plot okay and then each one is a c plot of the the everything plot okay so this is working quite fine okay as you can see here this is good to display for example a project the different area of of analysis okay if you want for example to analyze your data this is the perfect thing to show to show it to bring it down extremely easy and extremely fast okay fast okay so it's a really it's a very helpful tool to give you some bigger view okay of the overall data so you would know exactly what's going on with your data okay and you can explain it to others as well so over here I put the fake equals Maxi plot so I created the C plots over here it's the same thing same thing over here it's a little bit too long it's the same thing as SD those columns but it is with zip plots okay so with the c plot I've put it the the rows equals two and the columns equals two and the specs equals the type of the drawing okay so this is one over here it's a it's an X and eager drawing this one over here is a polar this is a domain and this is the same okay each one and its type so if you have an X and Y like this then you would put an X and Y okay the type of the chart is in X and Y and that's the type of the chart is polar okay each one and has have its own side so I put it each one and each side on this dictionary okay and govern suspect as an argument for the Maxi plots and later on we will use the C plus okay to print them on the figure it's a return only one argument okay so now I wanted to get the random numbers okay so because each time I reroll the page new data would come okay as you can see this chart is different from the next one so this is the first shot this is the second one as you can see it's totally different so I wanted to put some diversification over my data and how I've done that so using the sample and method of randent okay it would generate for example over here from 1 to 10 or an array of five elements okay so the Fig dot a trace I have added the trace and since as a parameter go dot bar okay I've used the bar over here so this is a bar chart okay this is the second one is bipolar the third one is a pi and the fourth one is the scattered 3D okay so not only you will use this one over here the type of the chart you will send it as a c plot argument and also you will add to that the type how you are going to draw it over here so over here think that address so this is the trace this is a bar uh this is a bar and send argument as go dot bar and then give it the the Y equals y because here over here I put y equals right end so I've sent you at the array and then the row which where is going to be plotted okay is going to be plotted over here the first row and the First Column over here okay this is its place I will go I will send the the array also the row the number of the row and the number of the column okay and also on the second chart the second chart is this one over here is the first row the second column so the first row the second column this is over here as you can see this one over here it's not showing up now it's showing up this one over here is the second plot over here so I've I've put the type bipolar and then I will give it the agreement the data and the error okay the data is generated it's going to get a num a random number from 0 to 360. so the 360 is extruded so the maximum number is from 0 to 359 okay and uh the length of the array is going to be 5. okay so I got random data you can add as much as you can you can add up to 10 20 14 you and how you want to Anna to display your data okay so I'm saying the argument data and as you can see those are the same names and this is no problem with python okay this is no problem and it would work just fine as long as you are not it's not a function so you can do it uh however you want and you can call it however you want okay so if you put its place on the row one and the column two and it's played for me this chart okay from the C plus the general C plus that take all the charts together as you can see here it's not different it's not like the same the first one for example over here as you can see this is on its own but over here everything is linked together this is all they are all C plots okay that's why we imported this library from property but C plot import make plots okay so it's not hanging there it's like that there is a purpose for it okay so after doing that we have drawn the bipolar and after the Barbara we're drowned the pie so the pie this is over here it see it says the pie it's on the second row and the First Column so second row and the First Column so this is the first column this is the second row as you can see it has the shape of a pipe okay and each thing on it has have its own color okay so how I have done that so same thing I've generated four random numbers okay so I realized four random numbers from one to five uh the zero is extruded so the the five is actually somewhere from one two four okay and after that I've added to other Trace through this workflow same thing as here and the other one so I I'm adding to the overall final plotting using a trace okay and yeah it's worked just fine and on the last one is going to put a scatter 3D so on the scatter 3D over here as you can see it is 3D printing so it displays the data on three dimension okay so this is a quite a big thing okay if you want for example to make it bigger let's make it bigger so over here it is bigger and everything is more clear okay so here here is your web application displaying your data however you want sorry in order to look at it to have a better look for it okay so over here this is your chart as you can see you can zoom only on one so you can put them on different chats if you want to have more zoom on it to work better on the data so you can use for example the previous version of SD column so each one will be plotted on each on its own place okay so by doing that it will require some work it's a it's not really complicated you can make it as a homework and work for it okay it's not complicated at all okay it has it have only only those things that I'm giving you here you can use them and plot those things it won't take too much time okay so as you can see it's plotted just fine so it needs as an agreement the ike the x-axis the y-axis in the Z axis so I've generated random numbers random numbers so and put them on those variables and when I call it fig does a tray so I I put what I'm going to trace to go but scattered really so scatter 3D I've sent as I come in the X so X This One X and the Y this one y and the Z this one Z so mod 9 so I put the mode lines in order to be a line okay this is the line so and then I put it where I wanted to plot it so on the second column and the second row okay and after all that I plotted through using this function St dot plotly charts chart fig and as an argument fig so fake as you can see here we added the trace to the fake and then we added and we added and we added stress and fake okay and and we will send it as an argument to be plotted at the end okay and it was working just fine and now let's jump to the fourth practice okay the practice number 14. this practice is a good one okay so it says to display a fourth chart using matplotlip two by two okay okay so as you can see here this is an image it's not interactive like the the previous one so you can over here save it as an image and it will be saved as the PNG image okay so as you can see this is an image so this is the difference between matplot clip and the plotly and the default plot function okay this is a quite good thing you know because you can just copy this image okay of your analyzed data and send it to someone to look at it okay it would be a good thing to to animate to analyze your data in a better way so however I've done this so using matplotlip Dot Plot dot pipelot this is not a plotly this is pi plot as PLT so I imported the library that I will I'm going to use and then I've added the fake and the access so this one C plus plot dot C plot BLT dot C plots okay over here we use it C plot but not BLD what is not badly okay so makes you plots same thing fake fake is in general the final uh the final data to be displayed so I put over here in Maxi plot it is plotly.c plot so this is don't make confusion between those two functions so this one over here is imported through from this library and this one over here is C plot is from the function of this Library okay they are not the same so I've put the C plus as you can see it does the return to arguments so it doesn't return the Fig the things things that we are going to give it to be plotted and the access so we would modify over here only the axis okay we won't modify the fake because we modify the the ax it would automatically modify the fake for us okay there is no need to modify the Fig okay so okay yeah so yeah so over here uh how I've done that so I put a random numbers from 0 to 6 on under length of the array is 10 so I've put the axis zero zero as you can see here I put two by two so on the zero zero this is the first one over here this one over the plot Number One so the plot Number One I gathered the title and then I plotted so I plotted X on this part and I set the title on it okay because at the end it would return an image so I plot on it and I set the title and then same thing with second second plot I put the the I the X I also put a tape so the the color of the child this one over here is going to be an orange okay you can do that as well with python so over here I didn't do it okay over here I didn't do it but here you can do it there is methods to do it over here because on here it's a simple it's a it's more simple than the previous one and you can do it on the previous one okay so if you're under the Titan so Titan plot Number One so plot Number Two tap orange and type green and tap red okay so this one over here is the first plot a second plot third blood and the fourth plot and then in order to get rid of this thing so as you can see here the numbers are this plot the number four plot Number Three as you can see there is no noise on the background but if we remove it okay let's try to remove this function over here I'm going to remove this part so I need to show you what what it is doing okay so this part we are going to remove it so let's remove it over here and save it and now let's redraw the page as you can see here the numbers of the x-axis is entering on the area of the title of the plot and this is not good for us okay so in order to avoid all those things we are going to use a for Loop in IX okay for IX in e i x dot flat so this one over here the flat the flat is this one over here this one is the flat so uh if I have called this function of a marble author so in order to display the the numbers to hide the numbers okay so it won't make problem for us and now let's put it back as you can see over here plot number three is now free okay it's uh there is no noise on the background and it's doing a job uh very well okay so this is it for today I really really hope you enjoyed because the solder of those practices if you like this video please leave a comment you can subscribe if you want if you have some questions feel free to ask me okay so thank you for watching and bye bye\""
